To log in to the R server, first make sure that you have the VPN switched on, or you will need to be connected to the university network (Eduroam). To set up the VPN, follow ISS [instructions here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/vpn/) or connecting to Eduroam [here](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/digital/services/university-it-network/wi-fi/).

When you are connected, navigate to [https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk](https://psy-rstudio.lancaster.ac.uk), where you will be shown a login screen that looks like the below. Click the option that says "Sign in with SAML".

This will take you through to the University login screen, where you should enter your username (e.g. ivorym) and then your university password. This will then redirect you to the R server where you can start using RStudio!

::: {.callout-note}
If you have already logged in through the university login already, perhaps to get to the portal, then you may not see the username/password screen. When you click login, you will be redirected straight to RStudio. This is because the server shares the login information securely across the university.

Welcome to Year 3!
:::

Congratulations, you have now completed the taught statistics modules! This year, you may have the opportunity to apply what you've learned to a new dataset: your undergraduate dissertation. This may seem daunting at first, but you have all the material on this site you can refer to, as well as the notes you have made yourself. 


Look out for information about the optional R support sessions too - designed specifically to help you with any difficulties you run into when analysing data as part of your dissertation project!
